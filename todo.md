# Chess Engine Development Todo List

## Board Representation
- [ ] Define chessboard representation (8x8 grid or bitboards)
- [ ] Create data structures for pieces and their positions
- [ ] Implement functions to initialize the board with standard chess setup
- [ ] Create functions to display the board state

## UI/UX
- [ ] Design a simple command-line interface for user interaction
- [ ] Implement a graphical user interface 
- [ ] Add functionality to input moves in standard notation (e.g., e4, Nf3)
- [ ] Implement a function to display the current game state
- [ ] Add functionality to save and load game states (PGN format)
- [ ] Implement a function to display the game history (move list)
- [ ] Add functionality to undo moves
- [ ] Implement a function to highlight legal moves for selected pieces
- [ ] Add functionality to switch between player and engine moves
- [ ] Implement a function to display captured pieces
- [ ] Add functionality to set time controls for the game
- [ ] Implement a function to display the current player's turn
- [ ] Add functionality to display the engine's thinking time

## Testing and Validation
- [ ] Test board representation and move generation
- [ ] Validate special moves and edge cases
- [ ] Test evaluation function
- [ ] Benchmark search algorithm performance
- [ ] Test complete engine with sample positions
- [ ] Compute engine's Elo rating against established engines
- [ ] Create a suite of unit tests for all components

## Move Generation
- [ ] Implement basic piece movement rules for all pieces
- [ ] Implement special moves (castling, en passant)
- [ ] Implement pawn promotion
- [ ] Implement move validation (checking if moves are legal)
- [ ] Implement check detection
- [ ] Implement checkmate and stalemate detection

## Position Evaluation
- [ ] Implement material counting (piece values)
- [ ] Create piece-square tables for positional evaluation
- [ ] Implement a static evaluation function combining material and position
- [ ] Add additional evaluation factors (king safety, pawn structure, etc.)

## Negamax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning
- [ ] Implement the basic Negamax algorithm
- [ ] Add Alpha-Beta pruning optimization
- [ ] Implement move ordering to improve pruning efficiency
- [ ] Add search depth control (3-5 plies minimum)
- [ ] Implement quiescence search for tactical stability

## Transposition Table
- [ ] Implement Zobrist hashing for board positions
- [ ] Create a transposition table data structure
- [ ] Implement table lookup and storage functions
- [ ] Add table entry replacement strategy
